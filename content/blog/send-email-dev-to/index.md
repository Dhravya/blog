While browsing Github, I found this cool Rust library called [`lettre`](https://github.com/lettre/lettre). Being a fan of CLI applications and productivity, I quickly made this rust script that lets you send emails, right from your terminal!

It's barely 50 lines of code and honestly a very simple project, but it gets the work done lol.

Send email by simply using this command
```
mailto hi@dhravya.dev Hi! What's up?
```

And yes, that's it.

## Installation

Use the command `cargo install mailto`, that's it!
