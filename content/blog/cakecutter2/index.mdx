title: A whole new developer ecosystem - Cakecutter
description: A couple months ago, I wrote a blog Introducing Cakecutter, which was, essentially, a modular version for create-python-project. Both of these projects were very easy, because they were just simple projects for me to practice the Rust programming language. I made them and forgot about it. But little did I know, small projects go a long way.
