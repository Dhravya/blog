  When I got started with programming, everywhere I went, I saw (good), but paid services. I would see them and say to myself ‚ÄúI really want to buy that when I get the money... It will help a lot‚Äù... And then, I came to know about Github‚Äôs student developer pack. But.... I got rejected... 15 times....

  If you‚Äôre a student, this is for you

  ## The benefits

  I‚Äôll only list the stuff I extensively use, and have become a part of my lifestyle now

  - Canva premium for a year
  - Educative pro for 6 months
  - Namecheap, .tech, [name.com](http://name.com) domains
  - Github PRO (I don‚Äôt know what extra stuff I get but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm using all of them loll)
  - Gitlens+ (Very useful)
  - Termius pro
  - Replit hacker plan for 3 months
  - Stripe waived transaction fees
  - Browerstack for testing and stuff (really good for compatibility tests too)

  Now that‚Äôs really good considering that all that is for FREE! For me, I use Educative the most, and there‚Äôs a lot more stuff that isn‚Äôt much useful for me but you might like 

  - Jetbrains IDE
  - Bootstrap studio
  - Azure, DigitalOcean credits
  - Productivity tools like Dashlane premium, Pomodone and HazeOver

  Damn

  ## How to get the pack

  It‚Äôs pretty easy, just go to [education.github.com/pack](http://education.github.com/pack) and hit this button

  ![https://us-east-1.tixte.net/uploads/img.dhravya.dev/l262foh770a.png](https://us-east-1.tixte.net/uploads/img.dhravya.dev/l262foh770a.png)

  Then you‚Äôll be asked to give your email, school name, etc. Fill those in, and finally you‚Äôll be asked to submit any document to prove that you‚Äôre a student. The only requirements are

  - Should have your name (and preferably photo)
  - Should have school name
  - Should have the date of the academic year

  ID cards are perfect for this.

  Well, it‚Äôs supposed to be that easy. But clearly it wasn‚Äôt so easy for me...

  ## My story (struggle)

So after I came to know about the students pack, I was actually shocked, and tried to apply immediately. However, I had just passed my 10th grade months ago, and I hadn‚Äôt received the ID card for my 11th grade, and since everything was online, I had nothing to show. So I just started with the proofs I had in 10th grade - ID card, report card, class photo. One by one, I submitted all of them.

I tried every day, and i think i‚Äôve kindaaa sent too many applications

I could not even contact support...

But FINALLY, I got a DM from Github education

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/GitHubEducation?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GithubEducation</a> Support is amazing. They saw my tweet and messaged me<br>And yes, I sent my email to them.... but they seem to be busy and haven&#39;t read my message quite yet.

(PS: It wasn‚Äôt as good. spoiler:  Didn‚Äôt get a reply for a month)

Issue was, they never replied back! And I didn‚Äôt message too much because I knew it gets annoying for whoever is handling the account. So I did one, final tweet, and they got back to me. *sigh*  

After a month of trying again and again, and even giving up for a couple weeks, I received it, finally.

![Got a DM](https://us-east-1.tixte.net/uploads/img.dhravya.dev/1A72.png)
