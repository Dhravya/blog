title: Never take Video recording for tutorials [Newsletter]
description: Often times, I found myself in situations where I had to show someone how to use a particular thing - like the one time i had to show my cousin how to create a github account and then, create a repository. I had to set up a zoom call, show them step-by-step. It was a very time consuming experience.
