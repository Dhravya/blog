This page was inspired by <a data-tip="Gergely Orosz is a software developer who spent 4 years in Amsterdam" href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/now/">Gergely Orosz</a>, [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff) and <a data-tip="I came to know about now pages because of Oscar. They also shared their now page on the Practically leading discord server, where I first discovered it" href="https://www.oscardominguez.dev/now">Oscar Dominguez</a>'s now pages\*.

Here's what I'm doing now:

<ul>
	<li key="el1">
		<a
			data-tip="Things I'm currently learning, or want to learn"
			href="#now-im-learning"
		>
			üéì Now I'm learning
		</a>
	</li>
	<li key="el2">
		<a data-tip="Projects I'm working on, or contributed to" href="#projects">
			üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Open Source and Personal Projects
		</a>
	</li>
	<li key="el3">

</ul>

## Next.js

I love web development, but my skills were holding me back from making amazing web applications. I started learning Next.js back in January, but didn't quite make it into my workflow.

So I decided to re-learn the foundations. I'm also working on multiple projects with Next.js, so I'm pretty excited about it.

I'm learning from the original documentation itself - [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/introduction/getting-started).

## Go

I'm a fan of the Go programming language It's very easy to learn, and I already managed to make a couple projects with it. But I'm also aware that I haven't nailed the fundamentals of the language, which is why I'm Go-ing through the basics again.

Again, from the official documentation - [Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/). and [Go by Examples](https://gobyexample.com/).

# üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Open Source and Personal Projects <a id='projects'></a>

This month started with a little bit of a burnout, I didn't have motivation to code anything! I think I overworked my limits, and I'm starting to feel a bit tired.
And I'm still not sure if I'm ready to start coding.

Which is why I'm working on lightweight projects with Python and updating this Blog

## Beautify This!

[Beautify this](https://beautify.dhravya.dev) is an API and web app that only does one thing - beautify stuff! For now, it supports Twitter Tweets.

To go with Beautify This, I also created [a Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/poet_this) and challenged myself at the start of the month to grow it as much as possible, and I'm proud of the progress so far.

(I'll be writing a blog about how I grew a twitter bot account from zero to hero in just ONE tweet, ONE day!)

<Tweet
	tweetLink="https://twitter.com/poet_this/status/1519288066233430017"
	theme="dark"
/>

The bot used to be called `Poet This`, but I decided to change it to `Beautify This` because it's a bit more catchy.
Earlier, I used to use [Poet.so](https://poet.so) and a Selenium webdriver to scrape tweets from there, but then switched to my own implementation using Python's [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) library.

The bot is currently running on [Railway](https://railway.app).

Give a follow!

## This blog

I'm also working a lot on this blog. With the latest update, I just implemented the following features:

- MDX support
- <a data-tip="Hello, world!" href="https://react-tooltip.netlify.com">
  	ToolTip
  </a>
- Bumped the versions of all dependencies and fixed breaking bugs
- Change in the UI a little bit
- The "Now" and "Previous" pages

Btw, this blog is open source! You can find it on [Github](https://github.com/dhravya/blog). While you're there, why not leave a ‚≠ê?

This blog also has support for comments using [Giscus](https://giscus.app).

## Open source contributions at Aviyel's Github repo

I got a message from Aviyel if I'd like to contribute some project demos to their Github repository, and I happily accepted.

I went ahead and made a Demo for integrating [Chatwoot](https://chatwoot.com) in multiple frameworks - NextJS, vanilla HTML [here](https://github.com/aviyelverse/project-templates-and-demos/pull/2)

I'll also be working on more of their requests

## SussyImage

I'm actively trying to make [SussyImage](https://github.com/dhravya/sussyimage) a little bit faster and more efficient.

I have more projects to work on, but I'm not sure if doing all of them at the same time is a good idea

## Now I'm reading

I've been reading a lot of books lately. The latest one which really got me hooked is [Atomic Habits](https://amzn.to/2QZQZQX). A really good book that talks about how small changes can make a really big difference in the long run.

I've just completed the first 2 chapters of it, and I'm looking forward to the rest.

Next, I wanna read [Can't hurt me](https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512287), which was recommended to me by a friend.

## Now I'm listening to

I recently bought the Spotify Premium account, so i've been listening to a lot of music lately.

Emptiness by Zodiac Wave is one of my favorites now, (maybe because I can relate, lol)

I also rediscovered this song that was my childhood favorites

## My hobbies now

Since I was burnt out of coding, I've started focusing more on my hobbies

Specifically, playing the Guitar (and singing along), Cycling more, reading, and working out

<hr
	style={{
		borderBottom: `1px solid`,
		height: 0,
		marginBottom: 1,
	}}
/>
