title: 'I created a Twitter bot to take screenshots of tweets'
description: 'Often times, after seeing a tweet, I go to https://poet.so to take a screenshot of it. However, this was kinda time consuming and stuff like that, but poet.so doesnt even have an API, so I create a selenium script that (very quickly) uses poet.so to take screenshots of a tweet.'
